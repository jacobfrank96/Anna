          <h2>Parent reviews</h2>
          <li>"G babysat my child. He is always on time and ready to work. He is a compassionate and patient. From my interactions with her, it is clear that he truly enjoys working with children."</li>
          <li>"Gadiel is a wonderful babysitter. We used him for babysitting, helping with child related errands and taking to and from activities. Gadiel is upbeat, punctual, very neat and tidy and has a lovely manner with children. Gadiel merged into our household very easily without fuss, my children adored him and ask after Gadiel often. I highly recommend Gadiel."</li>
          <li>"Gadiel was a good babysitter, he did everything I asked him to do and more. BUT I did not appreciate the way he spoke to my childer. He put on that classic, 'I'm speaking to a child so I have to change my voice in a very condesending way' voice."</li>
